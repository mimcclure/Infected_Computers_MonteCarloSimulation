# Infected_Computers_MonteCarloSimulation
Twenty computers are connected in a network. One computer becomes infected with a virus. Every day, this virus spreads from any infected computer to any uninfected computer with probability 0.1. Also, every day, a computer technician takes 5 infected computers at random (or all infected computers, if their number is less than 5) and removes the virus from them.
